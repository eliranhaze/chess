currently:
[v] new move ordering that uses mvv - testing in colab
[x] new checkmate/stalemate check - currently in engine3.py - to test next
	- tested, worse. not sure why - maybe there's a bug and it doesn't detect some checkmates/stalmates
	  early enough?
[v] currently testing again the checkmates issue with a fix of the original bug (engine3) and a fix of a second bug (engine3_1) - see more notes in results file
	- 3_1 version does work and is better
[v] killer moves
[x] retry that max sorting - more simply
	- no luck so far
[x] 200 delta pruning?
	- no significant differnece
[x] SEE in regular move ordering - salvage negative mvv captures that have >0 SEE
	- didn't seem promising
[v] SEE - currently running
	- was about the same, committing anyway
[_] history heuristic ordering - implemented (engine_history2) and waiting to run
[x] -500 vs -10000 killer value
	- -10000 was found to result in more prunning, but was somehow a bit slower - so check actual games
	- was slightly worse in testing
[_] kp val - remember that this was found to be worse than without - recheck

next:
- countermove history
- LMR
- syzygy tb
