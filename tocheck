currently:
[v] new move ordering that uses mvv - testing in colab
[x] new checkmate/stalemate check - currently in engine3.py - to test next
	- tested, worse. not sure why - maybe there's a bug and it doesn't detect some checkmates/stalmates
	  early enough?
[v] currently testing again the checkmates issue with a fix of the original bug (engine3) and a fix of a second bug (engine3_1) - see more notes in results file
	- 3_1 version does work and is better
[_] was checking SEE (engine_see2) implementation - seemed a bit better but got disconnected - check again at least 200 games per engine
	- see3 contains a correct version with xrays
	- see4 is like see3 but with speedup

[_] BETTER TIME LIMIT IMPLEMENTATION -- FOR MORE ACCURATE TESTING!! at negamax and qsearch levels
[_] Itergate pgn output / ordo elo calculation for testing
- killer moves - in both engine4.py and engine5.py - correct implementation is engine5.py (with plies)
	- see http://talkchess.com/forum3/viewtopic.php?t=46886&start=10#p503361 on how to implement (other
	  comments also helpful in that thread) - currently implementing only 1 killer move, but it was said
	  that 2 is crucial
- kp val - remember that this was found to be worse than without - recheck

optimizations:
- INF different value
- move.promotion == queen
- fut prune

concepts:
- killer move
- pruning bad moves in qs according to see
- simple syzygy
